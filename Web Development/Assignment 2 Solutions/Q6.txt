Q.6 Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ?

Z-index is used to define the position of element in terms of stack means which element would be in the top of other.
It is mainly used when you want to overlap two elements one over other.
For example a Z-index of zero is default and if set z-index -1 then that element will go behind of the zero z-index element
and if we set z index to 1 then it comes at the top.
