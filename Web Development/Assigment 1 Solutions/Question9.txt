Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

HTML tags are the one which are used to give the structure to the web page. They are generally written inside < >. Examples are- <div></div>, <p></p>, <body></body>, etc.

whereas attributes are used to give additional information to the tags which can modify the behaviour of a HTML element. Example- class, id ,style, type, etc.

Global attributes are the once which can be used with any tag irrespective of its nature. Example - class, id, style, etc.
